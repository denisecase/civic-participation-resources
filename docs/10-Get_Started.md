# Get Started (General Guide)

> "All politics is personal." — Robert Heinlein

Did you ever wonder how the options on your ballot got on the ballot in the first place? 

The American political party system operates in a defined sequence. 
The most important work begins long before November.



## Action 1. Choose Your Team (January)

First, choose a political party. 
Read the party platforms and decide which party most closely reflects your values and positions. 
Coalitions and spirited unity tend to have more impact. 

- [Democratic Party Platform](https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/)
- [Republican Party Platform](https://prod-static.gop.com/media/RNC2024-Platform.pdf)

In general, splinter parties and fractured coalitions functionally serve the dominant power structure, even if unintentionally.

- Foreign actors, bad faith domestic players, and extremist factions may actively encourage splintering.
- The more people peel off into smaller parties, the weaker the opposition becomes.
- This weakened the left in Germany in the 1930s.
- This weakened center-left parties in Israel over 25 years.
- This weakened Democrats in Florida, Missouri, Kansas, Wisconsin.
- This weakened traditional Republicans in Kansas.


## Action 2. Confirm Precinct Caucus or Primary Date and Time (January, even years)

This is where the critical action begins. 

- The date of your caucus or party meeting is often set by your state or party many months in advance.
- Some states set one uniform date for all parties; others allow parties to set their own.
- In most states, the date and time can be confirmed on your Secretary of State’s election website or through your state party.
- Confirm the date early so you can plan ahead.



## Action 3. Find Your Party Caucus Location (January, even years)

- Once you know the date, you’ll need to locate your party-specific meeting location.
- Location details are usually handled by your local party unit (county or precinct level).
- This may take some research, especially in smaller or volunteer-run counties.

How to locate your caucus location:

- Step 1. Check your state party website.
- Step 2. Use any available caucus location lookup tools.
- Step 3. If no tools exist, use state party websites to locate county chair contact info.
- Step 4. Email or call directly and ask: "Where is the next precinct caucus meeting?"
- Step 5. **Start early** and be persistent and polite. Local party volunteers may be slow to update public websites.

## Action 4. Plan to Participate (January, even years)

- Add the caucus date to your calendar with multiple reminders.
- Plan to arrive 15–30 minutes early.
- Bring ID (not always required but helpful for some party processes).
- There is typically no mail-in option for caucus participation.

## Action 5. Attend the Party Caucus meeting (~February, even years)
