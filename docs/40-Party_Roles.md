# Party Roles

Typical party roles start with the approximately 200,000 precincts across the United States.

Some state parties use **caucuses** (or caucus-style meetings) for party organization, while others fill roles through party **committee meetings, conventions, or appointments**.

Only a very few states still use caucuses as the primary means of _candidate selection_.

## Common Party Roles

Almost all major parties have:

- Precinct Chairs (or Captains)
- County or Congressional District organizing committees
- State conventions
- National conventions

## Filling Roles

The specific process for filling roles varies by state and party, but many parties use local precinct meetings, county conventions, and/or volunteer-based elections to fill these roles.

For more information, see your [state website](./91-State_Websites) and your [state-specific guide](./05-States.md).

## How Do People Get Involved?

- In some states, precinct caucuses provide a public starting point for party organizing and anyone can simply show up.
- In other states, parties fill many positions through internal party committee meetings, county conventions, or appointments by local party officers.
- In all cases, you can start by contacting your local county or district party to ask how to attend meetings or volunteer.
- Many parties welcome new volunteers who are willing to get involved.

## Precinct Chair and Vice Chair(s)

Sometimes called Precinct Captains. Some states encourage a gender balance.

**How you get the role:**

- In caucus states: Volunteer during your precinct caucus (~February).
- In most other states: Contact your local county or district party to ask how precinct leaders are selected.

**Who votes:**

- All caucus attendees from your precinct.

**What you do if elected:**

- Obtain your precinct map and voter list.
- Build a local contact network.
- Encourage neighbors to participate and vote.
- Serve as your precinct’s party contact.
- Coordinate with county and district leaders.
- Recruit volunteers for your precinct.

Precinct Chairs are often the most important link between voters and the party. Many precincts have no chair simply because no one volunteers.

## Convention Delegates

In many states, delegates are selected around the same time as precinct positions.

**How you may get the role:**
