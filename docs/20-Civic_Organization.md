## Who Controls What: U.S. Election Administration Structure

| Level | Controls |
|-------|--------------------|
| Federal (Congress, FEC, EAC) | Limited role — national standards, reporting, some funding |
| State (Secretary of State, State Election Board) | Statewide election laws, candidate filings, registration systems |
| County (or township in some states) | Precinct boundaries, polling places, ballots, election-day operations, tabulation |
| Precinct (operational unit) | Polling place operations, managed by county election officials |



## Federal Responsibilities

- Set national standards (Voting Rights Act, Help America Vote Act).
- Administer federal campaign finance (FEC).
- Provide guidance and limited funding through agencies like EAC.
- Federal government does not directly conduct elections.


## State Responsibilities

- Define state election laws and calendars.
- Manage voter registration systems.
- Administer candidate filing processes.
- Certify county results for statewide and federal offices.
- Oversee recounts, audits, and legal challenges.


## County Responsibilities

The county (or equivalent) is responsible for:

- Maintaining precinct boundaries.
- Assigning polling place locations.
- Preparing ballots (county races, ballot questions).
- Operating polling places on election day.
- Tabulating and reporting election results.

Some States Use Wards or Townships
- Especially common in New England and parts of the Midwest.
- In these states, townships may handle some functions counties typically manage elsewhere.



## Precinct Responsibilities

- Precincts are the smallest official election units.
- Managed by county election officials for public elections.
- Each precinct determines:
  - Which ballot each voter receives (districts, school zones, city wards, etc.)
  - Where each voter is assigned to vote (polling place location).

On Election Day:
- Poll workers staff the precinct polling locations.
- Verify voter eligibility and check voter rolls.
- Issue ballots and operate tabulators.
- Report precinct-level results after polls close.

Precinct-level election officials (poll workers) are typically temporary, nonpartisan staff recruited for each election cycle.


### Party Precinct Organization

Political parties also organize at the precinct level. Each party may:

- Hold **precinct caucuses**.
- Elect **precinct chairs** and **vice chairs**.
- Select **delegates** to attend higher-level conventions.
- Support voter outreach and party-building at the neighborhood level.

Party activities operate separately from official government election administration.  
Each political party establishes its own internal rules for these roles and meetings.


## Precincts and Counties Are Critical in Elections

- Most states have 50–100 counties (or county-equivalents).
- The U.S. has ~3,100 counties and ~200,000 precincts. 
- The number of precincts (and their boundaries) may change each year. See your county for the most current information.

Typical Precinct Sizes

| Type of Area       | Typical # of Voters per Precinct |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Urban (dense cities) | 500 – 3,000 voters               |
| Suburban            | 1,000 – 2,500 voters              |
| Rural               | 100 – 800 voters                  |
| Extremely rural     | Sometimes under 100 voters        |

### Why This Matters

- Elections are highly **decentralized**.
- Control is distributed across thousands of counties and hundreds of thousands of precincts.
- In many precincts, only a small number of participants attend local caucuses or meetings.
- Because each unit is small, every person attending makes a measurable difference.
- Many party precinct positions remain vacant simply because **not enough people show up**.
