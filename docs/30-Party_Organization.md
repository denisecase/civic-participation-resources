# Party Organization and Events

Both major parties typically organize using the official election precinct map set by the state or county. 

A common first activity is the party caucus.
A caucus is a neighborhood meeting of party members who gather in person to select local leaders, choose delegates, and discuss party business.

Multiple precinct caucuses are often held at the same physical location for convenience, but each precinct meets separately to select its own leaders and delegates.

## Party Caucuses (~February, even-numbered years)

The first - and most critical - event for new participants is often the **precinct caucus**.

At the precinct caucus:

- Attend with other registered party voters who live in your same precinct.
- You may volunteer for party positions:
  - **Precinct Chair** or **Vice Chair**.
  - **Delegate** to the next-level convention.
- Platform resolutions may be introduced.
- Local party leadership may explain upcoming opportunities.
- Caucuses are usually held on a single statewide date set by law or party rule.

**Precinct caucuses are often lightly attended. Your participation matters.**


## Evolving Systems: Party Caucuses, Primaries, and Party Meetings

Party organizing processes vary by state and by party.

- Some states and parties continue to use **precinct caucuses** as the main organizing event.
- Some have moved to **primaries** for candidate selection but still use separate local party meetings for organizing leadership roles.
- In a few states, **party leadership positions are elected directly by party members during primaries** or by internal party committee votes.

Regardless of the method:

- **Early participation remains critical.**
- Contact your local party (county or organizing unit) to learn the process used in your area.
- In every system, volunteers are needed to serve as Precinct Officers, Delegates, Directors, and Convention Participants.
- Many positions are filled simply by showing up and volunteering.

## Organizing Unit Conventions (~March, even-numbered years)

Organizing Unit Conventions follow the precinct caucuses.

- Convention delegates elected at the caucus attend.
- Alternates may attend, and should be ready to serve if needed.
- Visitors may observe but do not vote.

The convention typically includes:

- Candidate speeches and endorsement votes.
- Review and voting on platform resolutions submitted from precinct caucuses.
- Election of Organizing Unit Officers (Chair, Vice Chairs, Secretary, Treasurer).
- Election of Directors for roles such as outreach, events, or fundraising.
- Election of Delegates for the Congressional District and State Conventions.

_Many positions are filled simply by volunteers stating their willingness to serve._


## Congressional District Conventions  (~April, even-numbered years)

- Delegates elected at the Organizing Unit Convention attend.
- Endorse Congressional candidates.
- Elect national delegates.
- Review additional platform positions.

## State Conventions (~May, even-numbered years)

- Delegates elected at prior conventions attend.
- Endorse statewide candidates (Governor, U.S. Senate, etc.).
- Approve party platform positions.
- Elect remaining national delegates.

## National Conventions (~July, presidential election years)

- National delegates attend.
- Officially nominate the party's Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates.
