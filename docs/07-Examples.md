# Notes


## A Tale of Two States

To see the effects of participation, consider the following stories:

- [Missouri: Decline of Democratic Party Participation](examples/Missouri.md)  
- [Kansas: Intra-Party Realignment (1980s to mid‑2010s)](examples/Kansas.md)



## Key Similarities

| Dynamic               | Kansas                                      | Missouri                                      |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Initial Party Weakness | Limited competition between factions     | Limited candidate recruitment infrastructure  |
| Key Entry Point      | Low-turnout primaries                      | Filing period management; uncontested filings |
| Strategy             | Early organization; fill leadership roles  | Recruit placeholder candidates to maintain control |
| Voter Engagement     | Small, highly organized groups    | Limited public participation                  |
| Long‑Term Outcome    | Party reorganization with periodic shifts  | Reduced competitive balance in many districts |



## Lessons Learned

> **Low participation combined with high organization can allow small groups to control party structures.**

When civic participation drops, decisions may increasingly be made by smaller, highly organized groups rather than broad majorities.



## Some See Lower Participation
