# Kansas: Intra-Party Realignment (1980s to mid‑2010s)

## What Happened

Kansas was long governed by fiscally conservative, business-oriented Republicans led by figures like Bob Dole and Alf Landon.

Starting in the 1990s and 2000s, culturally conservative networks, such as church-affiliated voter groups, advocacy organizations, and issue-focused coalitions built powerful voter networks in Kansas.

With low-turnout primaries, cultural conservatives used targeted community outreach, church networks, membership lists, and canvassing to unseat incumbents and elect like-minded precinct officers.

The more conservative faction consolidated control over the local party, winning party chair positions, dominating endorsements, and controlling state legislative primaries.

Elected in 2010, Governor Sam Brownback implemented deep tax cuts, known as the *Kansas Experiment*, promoting aggressive supply-side economic reforms.

## The Consequences

The party shifted sharply toward more conservative policymaking and deep tax cuts, pushing out moderates and splitting the party’s business wing.

Kansas experienced multi-billion-dollar revenue shortfalls, resulting in major cuts to education, healthcare, transportation, and core services.

Beginning in 2012, moderate Republicans, Democrats, and independents formed bipartisan coalitions to override Brownback’s vetoes and reverse key tax policies.

In 2017, the Kansas legislature repealed Brownback’s tax cuts and returned to more pragmatic fiscal policies. Medicaid expansion followed, signaling broader institutional stabilization.

## What Works: Mobilization & Process

| Practice | Mechanism | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Precinct Officer Strategy** | Conservatives targeted local precinct chair and committee roles | Controlled slates, endorsements, and primaries |
| **Low-Turnout Focus** | Focused mobilization in church-centered voting blocs | Won primaries with small, active groups |
| **Candidate Pipeline** | Fielded reliable challengers | Replaced incumbents with ideological allies |
| **Data & Coordination** | Shared voter data, financial networks, and aligned messaging | Sustained power across multiple election cycles |
| **Counter-Mobilization** | Broad bipartisan resistance when outcomes became unsustainable | Restored balance through override coalitions |

## Why It Matters

- **Organized small groups can capture large systems** when procedural participation is weak.
- **Primaries matter**: Many of the most consequential shifts happened before general elections, at the precinct and nomination level.
- **Party infrastructure matters**: Precinct chairs, state committee seats, and delegate roles enable long-term directional control.
- **Amending is possible, but slow**: Correcting imbalances can take years of rebuilding alliances, coalitions, and institutional trust.

## Lessons Learned

Kansas provides a key example of how focused participation at the **precinct level** can reshape an entire party and, by extension, state governance.
