# Missouri: Decline of Democratic Party Participation

## What Happened (roughly 2000s to present)

Missouri was once a competitive swing state into the 1990s, but by 2010 it shifted heavily Republican, particularly in rural and ex-urban areas.

Key changes included:
- Republican dominance in statewide and legislative offices.
- Democratic donor networks weakened and infrastructure eroded.
- Young participants disengaged or moved away.
- County-level Democratic Party infrastructure eroded in many rural counties.
- Republicans heavily invested in candidate pipelines.

## The "Paper Candidate" Phenomenon

In some districts, candidates filed nominally as Democrats but engaged in little or no campaigning, leaving general elections effectively uncontested and reducing voter choice.


## The Downstream Result

- Democrats haven't held statewide control since 2012.
- Many rural county committees are inactive or empty.
- Fewer authentic candidates are filing.
- Many voters remain registered but have fewer viable choices.

## The Continuing Challenge

Missouri Democrats now rely on party-run primaries for presidential delegate selection (since 2022), but many precinct-level and county-level leadership roles remain vacant.
The core problem is not the method of delegate selection, but the decline in precinct and county-level participation.

## What's Lost When People Stop Participating

- Empty caucuses and vacant roles allow others to control party slates and platforms.
- Low participation enables weak or unopposed candidates. 
- Without precinct chairs, voters lose connection to party leadership.
- Dominance by a single party reduces choice and accountability.


## What Missouri Voters Can Do: Starting at the Precinct Level

| Action | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Participate in party meetings and primaries** | Active participation is critical. |
| **Volunteer for Precinct Chair or Vice Chair** | Strengthen local organization. |
| **Volunteer as a Delegate** | Help select candidates and platform direction. |
| **Support neighbors** | Build robust precinct engagement. |
| **Run for County Party Committees** | Rebuild infrastructure from the ground up. |
| **Identify open seats and filing deadlines** | Recruit strong candidates early. |
| **Build contact lists year-round** | Keep precincts engaged beyond elections. |
| **Sustain county networks off-election years** | Maintain operational momentum. |
| **Support strong candidates** | Invest in quality representation. |


## Why This Matters

- **Precinct chairs** form the fundamental building blocks of party organization.
- **Delegates** shape candidate selection before the ballots get printed.
- **County committees** provide party stability across regions.

## Lessons Learned

The decline of Missouri Democratic Party participation stems from long-term disengagement and weak candidate infrastructure.  
**Local participation remains essential to rebuilding party strength.**
