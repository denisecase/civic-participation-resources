# Party Organization and Events

Both major parties typically organize using the official election precinct map set by the state or county. 

## Precinct Caucuses (~February, even-numbered years)

The first - and most critical - event for new participants is the **precinct caucus**.

At the precinct caucus:

- Attend with other registered party voters who live in your same precinct.
- You may volunteer for party positions:
  - **Precinct Chair** or **Vice Chair**.
  - **Delegate** to the next-level convention.
- Platform resolutions may be introduced.
- Local party leadership may explain upcoming opportunities.
- Caucuses are usually held on a single statewide date set by law or party rule.

> **Precinct caucuses are often lightly attended. Your participation matters.**


## Organizing Unit Conventions (~March, even-numbered years)


Organizing Unit Conventions follow the precinct caucuses.

- Convention delegates elected at the caucus attend.
- Alternates may attend, and should be ready to serve if needed.
- Visitors may observe but do not vote.

The convention typically includes:

- Candidate speeches and endorsement votes.
- Review and voting on platform resolutions submitted from precinct caucuses.
- Election of Organizing Unit Officers (Chair, Vice Chairs, Secretary, Treasurer).
- Election of Directors for roles such as outreach, events, or fundraising.
- Election of Delegates for the Congressional District and State Conventions.

_Many positions are filled simply by volunteers stating their willingness to serve._


## Congressional District Conventions  (~April, even-numbered years)

- Delegates elected at the Organizing Unit Convention attend.
- Endorse Congressional candidates.

- Review additional platform positions.

## State Conventions (~May, even-numbered years)
